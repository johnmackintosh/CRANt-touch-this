## Compendium

A veritable cornucopia of things to read and work through. 

Particularly:
https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/awesome-r-pkgtools#cran-checks-submission-and-status-


urlchecker - 

https://github.com/r-lib/urlchecker has functions that find errant URLs, and updates them if they need redirecting, or if they are just plain wrong. 
I failed submission because of a missing trailing '/' in a URL, don't let that happen to you.
